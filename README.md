# How Computers Work (v2)
by Joshua Higgins

-----

### General Overview
This unit is an alternate approach to BJC's "How Computers Work" Unit, the first unit covered after the AP CSP exam. Since this is no longer tied to the AP CSP topic pool, this unit goes from discussion of hardware and surface electrical engineering up through to the program level. There are jumps in-between for the sake of unit scope, and in fact much of the unit involves simulation and live demonstration leading into class discussion. By the end of this unit, students will be able to identify what common hardware numbers mean (such as megahertz, clockrate, etc.) in addition to understanding computer fundamentals such as operating system compatibility, architecture, and organization. This is a unit of both utility and hardware exploration.

### Motivation for Unit
At my school, all students have taken chemistry and have either taken physics or are enrolled in physics. As a result, we can dive a little deeper into the physics behind the hardware. Of course, nothing that would qualify as a full understanding of hardware, but enough that should curiosity rise there's now a fertile bed of comprehension. I find BJC's unit to mean well, but a disservice for the students I have who want to look *inward* rather than *outward* on these machines. By letting students see the logic and science behind hardware (past and present) we also open the door toward *proper hardware care*. By going a bit deeper into low-level languages, along with operating system fundamentals we open the door toward *foundations of logic* as well as giving them a good base kit for *technical support skills* to help debug and assess personal computers that maybe aren't operating as preferred.

Again, this unit isn't one to conquer all of computer science, but it's supposed to be a parade of next-steps and what-ifs for students. Those that are interested in subfields now have a great basis for self-study, and those that are not have greater *technical literacy* with computers.

### Standards Referenced
* 9-12.NSD.1: Design a solution to a problem that utilizes embedded systems to automatically gather input from the environment.
* 9-12.NSD.2: Explain the levels of interaction existing between the application software, system software, and hardware of a computing system.
* 9-12.NSD.3: Develop and communicate multi-step troubleshooting strategies others can use to identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.
* 9-12.CT.1: Create a simple digital model that makes predictions of outcomes.
